        <p>
          I'm an engineering graduate with expertise in Python, Data Science,
          and Engineering. I love solving problems and finding creative
          solutions in new ventures. Outside of my work, I love finding new ways
          to challenge myself by taking on new prusuits: be it culinary
          experimentations, expanding my programming skills, or dig into the
          specifics of new tech. Find more about my projects and work below!
